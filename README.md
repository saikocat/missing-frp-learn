# missing-frp-learn
Trying to do https://gist.github.com/staltz/868e7e9bc2a7b8c1f754 in a FP-galore stack

Welp, I've got a complete wrong design. My implementation of the whole Suggestion
Box is actually closer to the gist's Suggestion Item. Nevertheless, it was fun.

## Stack
* React
* Kefir
* Fetch
* ES6
* jspm

## How to run
Install the dependencies

```
$ mkdir clone && clone && cd clone
$ npm install -g jspm
$ jspm install
```

Then server it with whatever your server you are comfortable with.
